Qt Certificate Addon
====================

This is the start of some work to create a nice Qt-style API for creating SSL
certificates. Unlike the QSsl classes in the QtNetwork module, it uses the
gnutls library, but it automatically converts between the two, for example a
created certificate is returned as a QSslCertificate.
