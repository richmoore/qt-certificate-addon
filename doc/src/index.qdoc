  \brief The Certificate module provides facilities for creating X.509
  certificates.

  This is the start of some work to create a nice Qt-style API for creating SSL
  certificates. Unlike the QSsl classes in the QtNetwork module, it uses the
  gnutls library, but it automatically converts between the two, for example a
  created certificate is returned as a QSslCertificate.
